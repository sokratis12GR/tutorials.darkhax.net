#Tutorials
This repository is the home for my tutorial site [tutorials.darkhax.net](tutorials.darkhax.net). This site combines Jekyll and Google Pages to function. The theme, and heavy lifting were done by [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com/). For more information on this theme check out the [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) github page.
