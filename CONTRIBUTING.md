# Things to know
- Markdown (.md) files in `tutorials/` are turned into tutorial pages.
- Tutorial files should use lower camel case.
- Tutorial files are required to include an info header. Please modify the one included with this post. 
- Key phrases such as class names and methods should be highlighted by surrouding them with `s.
- Code should always be in code blocks. A code block is defined by surrounding it with three `s. 
- Java code should always use syntax highlighting. This requires the word `java` to be after the initial three `s.
- Do not add your page to the config manually. I want to prevent merge conflicts.
